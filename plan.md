## Voice Dictation

Elevenlab for TTS, voice id (Freya)

- get voice ids (https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices)

```js
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "xi-api-key": "259509a86a83f5d7a43102bd12779d33",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: '{"text":"hello benaiah, how are you doing?","voice_settings":{"similarity_boost":0,"stability":0}}',
};

fetch(
  "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/jsCqWAovK2LkecY7zXl4",
  options
)
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer()) // Convert the response to an ArrayBuffer
  .then((data) => playAudio(data)) // Pass the ArrayBuffer to the playAudio function
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));

function playAudio(audioBuffer) {
  // Initialize the AudioContext
  const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

  // Decode the audioBuffer into an AudioBuffer
  audioContext.decodeAudioData(
    audioBuffer,
    function (buffer) {
      // Create an AudioBufferSourceNode
      const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();

      // Set the buffer to the decoded AudioBuffer
      source.buffer = buffer;

      // Connect the AudioBufferSourceNode to the AudioContext's destination (e.g., speakers)
      source.connect(audioContext.destination);

      // Start playing the audio
      source.start(0);
    },
    function (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  );
